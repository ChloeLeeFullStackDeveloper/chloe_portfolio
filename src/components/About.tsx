      <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 max-w-xl leading-relaxed">
        I'm a full stack software developer with a strong foundation in Computer
        Science and hands-on experience building web applications using modern
        tools like React, TypeScript, Firebase, and Azure. I enjoy combining
        frontend aesthetics with backend logic to build fast, scalable, and
        user-friendly products.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 max-w-xl leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I’ve also explored AI integrations, working on tools that use natural
        language and data-driven features. I'm always learning and looking to
        build things that are not only functional — but meaningful.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 max-w-xl leading-relaxed">
        I'm currently open to internship or junior developer roles, and actively
        building personal projects to keep learning and growing.
